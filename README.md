## Title: Suicide Among U.S. Veterans

This project is showing the number of suicides among US Veterans in past years and using that data to predict the number of suicides in the future. There are many factors that could cause someone to commit suicide however, this project will focus on numbers alone. WE cans see the number of veterans at risk for suicide in future years and take steps to prevent them.

Overleaf, LaTex, GitHub, Python, Excel have been used to create this project.

Data has been cleaned in the following ways:
    -All of the data files were cleaned in Excel. The data original data files were fairly clean to begin with. The only changes made were formatting values to two decimal places and deleting unnecessary columns in Excel. The files were all saved in the CSV format so it was easiest to open them in Excel and format them that way instead of using Pyton code.
    -All the data files that begin with c, are the cleaned data files. The original data files are still included in this project.
